## Labyrinth && Fill

### Fill

A black and white photo is given represented by a binary matrix. Count the objects in the photo, knowing that an object consists of adjacent 1 values (8 adjacency positions N,NE,E,SE,S,SW,W,NW).

### Labyrinth

Given a maze represented by a binary matrix n x m. A[i][j]={0,1}|0<=i<n, 0<=j<m. A[i][j]=1 – at coordinate point i and j where there is a wall, A[i][j]=0 – at coordinate point i and j where there is is no wall. Given that a room is represented by an element in the matrix, display all the possibilities of exiting the labyrinth starting from a point at coordinates (x,y).
